It\u2019s difficult to determine their exact age because they shed their hard shell when they molt, leaving no evidence of age. But scientists believe some American lobsters may live to be 100 years old.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>They can weigh up to 44 pounds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters must periodically molt in order to grow, shedding their hard, external skeleton (shell) when they grow too large for it and forming a new one. They eat voraciously after they molt, often devouring their own recently vacated shells. Eating their shell replenishes lost calcium and helps harden their new shell.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters molt about 20 to 25 times over a period of 5 to 8 years between the time they hatch and when they are able to reproduce and reach the minimum legal size to be harvested.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Usually, lobsters mate after the females molt. Males deposit sperm in the soft-shelled females. The female stores the sperm internally for up to a year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Females can have 5,000 to more than 100,000 eggs, depending on their size. The eggs are fertilized as females release them on the underside of their tails, where they carry the eggs for 9 to 11 months.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Egg-bearing females move inshore to hatch their eggs during late spring or early summer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The pelagic (free-swimming) larvae molt four times before they resemble adults and settle to the bottom.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters are opportunistic feeders, feeding on whatever prey is most available, so their diet varies regionally.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Larvae and postlarvae are carnivorous and eat zooplankton (tiny floating animals) during their first year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Adults are omnivorous, feeding on crabs, mollusks, worms, sea urchins, sea stars, fish, and macroalgae.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In general, a variety of bottom-dwelling species feed on lobster, including fish, sharks, rays, skates, octopuses, and crabs. Young lobsters are especially vulnerable to predators.

To reduce injuries and deaths of large whales due to fisheries interactions, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov\/Protected\/whaletrp\/\">Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan<\/a> was implemented in 1997. Lobstermen must follow a number of regulations to protect large whales from fishing gear. For example, lobstermen must use sinking groundlines between traps to reduce the amount of line in the water column, which reduces the potential for whales and other protected species to become entangled. In addition, lobster permit holders are required to haul their active traps at least once every 30 days.<\/li>\n<li>Traps can incidentally catch finfish and invertebrates (such as crabs and conch). Regulations require traps to be configured with biodegradable escape panels or hinges on traps to prevent ghost fishing (lost gear that continues to capture lobster and other species and may pose a hazard to other marine species).
